Welcome, user!

Since I was born, I always love reading, learning, sport.
My curiosity about programming, history, psychology, writing increased signicantly in recent years.
That's why i decided to start this blog, share personal thoughts and document my life.
I think it will help me to devise new ideas and give readers simple and practical explanation.

Currently I'm studying in [Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University](https://pnu.edu.ua).

Feel free to send PR if you found an error.
