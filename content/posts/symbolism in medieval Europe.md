In medieval times, specifically in Europe, symbols were used to represent complicated themes, through pictures.
These topics includes: religions paintings, battles and significant figures to illustrate the power of monarchies.
The paintings show the culture to the common people who often can't read by that time due to various reasons.
I must admit, they are beatiful even by todays standard. Maybe of it's simplicity.

Banners played a significant symbol in the battles. Ensign was responsible for holding saint banner.
If it falls and enemy capture it, the ensign responsible for this particular banner will be executed.
For example: in battle of Marginano in 1515 a dead Landsknechts was found with his hands chopped off.

# Colors

In Medieval Ages people believed there are 7 primary colors: yellow, green, blue, red, white, black and purple.
Yellow used to portrait a betrayal, Jews and other bad things in the late Middle Ages.
However, it was often associated with gold and luxury before that.
Green was being used to represent something good in Quran and often associated with Islam.
The seas were drawn in green as something calm and pleasant.
Red and white were used in the chess games, instead of white and black.
White and black were related to good and evil, beatiful and ugly.

# Crusades

The red cross symbolize Christians who fought against Islam expansion.
They often can be seen on the shilds, clothes.
Furthermore, it associated with chivalry, faith and Pope Urban II military campaign of reclaiming Jerusalem.
That's why religious Jews might hate Christianity.
The soldiers of the Christ (or Knights Templar) were Catholics.
